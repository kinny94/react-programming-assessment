# React Programming Assignment - ITunes Album Finder - [Link](https://react-assessment-test.firebaseapp.com/)
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a react programming assignment for InRhythm. The project makes a call to the the Itunes API and fetches the fata from it.
I have used Bootstrap 4 for handling the CSS Styles. The project is being hosted on Firebase and here is the link to the live programming Assignment. [ITunes Album Finder](https://react-assessment-test.firebaseapp.com/).

The project requirements were as follows:-
1. Create a github Repo or Click 'Fork' from the top menu and generate your own JSFiddle link. 
Be sure to click 'Update' when your work is done.

2. Create a Search Component for entering an Artist

3. On Search, make an api call to iTunes API to fetch the information about the artist
   API URL: https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=${ARTIST_NAME}

4. When the Search button is clicked, make a call to the API and display the list of albums, including the album name and album cover inside 	#albums-container in a grid. Use any CSS technique you are comfortable with (Note: The API will return a list of albums based on the 		search result. Use your skills to find out what the iTunes API data structure looks like and extract the relevant data from it).

5. Style the page to the best of the ability to make the UI look clean and presentable

6. Checkin or Click Update from the top Menu and save the link


The project uses one other JavaScript library called VelocityJS for animations, which is much more efficient than jQuery. 

If you are downloading the zip file from Github, then type the following two commands to run the project.
  1.) npm install
  2.) npm start

The project wil be hosted at https://localhost:3000
